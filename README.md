🖋 About Project:


👉 An online banking system built using Python. This system allows the customer and banking staff/manager to manage all transactions easily.
👉 The primary purpose of this system is to simulate customer’s transaction management for Bank to maintain the detail of each transaction/record.

👉 There are 2 users for this system:

1.Admin
   Can create new Customer’s profile and provide them login id and password to access the system.
   Can view and search customer profile accordingly.
   Can view all transactions of specific customer.
2.Customer
   Can login to the system.
   Can do the transactions like Deposit, Withdrawal.
   Can view their own transactions.
Note: Every user needs to sign in to access the system. All the data must be stored in text (.txt) files.

👉 In this online banking system, there are 11 different menus, namely:

1.Main Menu
2.Admin

   -->Admin Login
   
   -->Admin Menu
   
   -->Admin New Profile
   
   -->Admin Search Customer Data
   
   -->Admin Search Customer Transaction
3.Customer

   -->Customer Menu 
   
   -->Customer Deposit
   
   -->Customer Withdraw
   
   -->Customer View
👉 All the psudeocode for each menu are available here
👉 All the flowchart for each menu are available here

👉 There is also a simple security verification in this system where the customer/admin is asked to enter a password and user id.
👉 Suppose the user id/password is not the same as the database (txt file), the system will ask the user to enter the user id/password again until it is correct.
